# if vertices are grouped by their values (2nd column in this file), the expected graph is:
# vertices:
# 0, 1, 6, 9, 10
# edges if self loops are removed and edges are aggregated by max:
# (0, 1, 0.1)
# (1, 6, 2.4)
# (6, 10, 4.10)
# (6, 9, 5.8)
# (9, 6, 9.4)
# edges if self loops are NOT removed and edges are aggregated by max:
# in addition to above edges: 
# (1, 1, 3.2)
# (6, 6, 7.5)
# (9, 9, 9.8)
